# üìö Online Bookstore API
Welcome to the Online Book Store API!
This project is designed to provide a seamless and efficient way to manage an online book store's inventory, customer orders, and user accounts.
Whether you are an independent bookstore owner looking to digitize your catalog or a developer seeking a robust backend solution for an e-commerce platform,
this API is tailored to meet your needs.

## ‚ú® Project inspiration
The inspiration for this project stemmed from the need for a modern, flexible, and easy-to-use backend system that can handle the complexities
of managing an online book store. In an age where digital transformation is key to staying competitive, many bookstores still struggle with outdated systems
that are not scalable or adaptable to the evolving market demands. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a powerful API built on reliable and well-supported
technologies like Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the API. 
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing pre-configured templates and reducing boilerplate code. It helps in quickly setting up the API with minimal configuration.
- **MySQL**: Database management system
- **Spring Data JPA**: A part of the Spring framework that provides easy integration with JPA (Java Persistence API) to simplify data access and manipulation.
- **Spring Security**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats.
- **Spring Web**: Simplifies the development of web applications by providing built-in support for common web functionalities.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for project management and dependency management.
- **Swagger**: Interactive API documentation and testing
- **Testcontainers, JUnit & Mockito**: For testing
- **GitHub Actions**: CI (Continuous integration) tool
- **Checkstyle plugin**: Helps to keep code style clean and consistent

## ‚ùó How to use

1. Open documentation at http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui.html
2. Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with API

## üè£ Postman collection

To facilitate testing and exploration of our Online Bookstore API, we have provided a Postman collection. This collection is a comprehensive set of pre-configured API requests that demonstrate the functionality of the API.

[![Open in postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/flight-cosmonaut-8680004/workspace/kaiiiseeel/collection/34443387-258e23b2-2831-4b7f-a5e7-7ac546ccdb80?action=share&creator=34443387)

## üöÄ Project functionality

### üîë Authentication

<details>
<summary>Endpoints for user authentication</summary>

- **Register a new user**
    - Request: `POST /api/auth/registration`
```json
  {
    "email": "usermail@gmail.com",
    "password": "awesomePassword123",
    "repeatedPassword": "awesomePassword123",
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Alison"
  }
```
- **Login user**
  - Request: `POST /api/auth/login`
```json
{
    "email": "usermail@gmail.com",
    "password": "awesomePassword123"
}
```

In response to login request we will get JWT: 
```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0QGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxODA0NDA0MiwiZXhwIjoxNzE4MDU4NDQyfQ.xh2soBCL2oDE21NdqEeNj9hyM9Z7pcGB2dH22Z8w1Fo"
}
```

We will use it in our future request to secure endpoints where authentication required

To use it in Postman, go to the auth section,
select the bearer token type and paste the resulting token into the appropriate field

</details>

#### **Examples:** 

To test the application you can use already created users

- **Admin**:
  - ```json
    {
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "pass1234"
    }
    ```
- **User**: 
  - ```json
    {
    "email": "bob.jackson@example.com",
    "password": "pass0000"
    }
    ```

## üî• Challenges Faced

- **Security and Authentication** - Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data. Solution - use of JWT.
<br></br>
- **API documentation** - Providing clear and comprehensive documentation for the API to facilitate ease of use by other developers. Solution - swagger for generation interactive documentation
<br></br>
- **Code Quality and Consistency** - Ensuring the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and adheres to best practices throughout the development lifecycle. Solution - checkstyle plugin, CI tool
<br></br>
- **Handling Database Migrations** - Managing database schema changes in a reliable and maintainable way across different environments. Solution - Liquibase was integrated to handle database migrations.
